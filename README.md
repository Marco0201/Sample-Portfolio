# About
A repository that hosts a sample [portfolio](https://marco0201.github.io/Sample-Portfolio/).
# Techs used
Html, Css
# Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability, but almost always for design purposes.
# Lessons Learned
One of the most valuable lessons I learned while completing this portfolio project was the importance of understanding the position property and values in CSS.
